Flake8 is included in the requirements to be installed.

Exceptions to this rule are considered for the following:
* Lines with HTML Replacement Text which normally would exceed the 80 character limit
* 80 Characters is defined at the line start (after indentations)
  ex 1 indent = 84 chars, 2 indents = 88 chars, etc.
